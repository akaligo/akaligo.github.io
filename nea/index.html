  <p>Welcome NEA members and congratulations on your pending trip to Thailand.</p>

<p>Education International has a page dedicated to the <a href="http://events.ei-ie.org/events/ei-s-8th-world-congress/event-summary-05cd63e204c54875a6857aa33ce77363.aspx">Education World Congress</a> with a welcome video and some basic information like how to get to the convention center.</p>

<p>I thought, perhaps, I could offer some more specific information.</p>

<p>If I can help with anything, add your email address to the box below or email me directly: brad@thailandetcetera.com.</p>

<h2 id="visas">Visas</h2>

<p>Unless you plan on staying for more than two months I would <em>not</em> recommend getting a visa before you go. With an American passport you’ll get a 30 day visa-on-arrival. If you plan to stay longer than this take a trip to Penang Malaysia and when you come back to Thailand you’ll get another 30 days.</p>

<p>If you’d rather stay in Thailand the whole time, it is about $20 cheaper to get a 60-day visa before you go instead of doing a visa extension while you’re there. Check details for tourist visas on the <a href="https://thaiembdc.org/consular-services/tourist-visas/category-tr/">Thai Embassy website</a>.</p>

<p>No matter which option you choose, do <em>not</em> get in the “visa on arrival” line when you get to the Bangkok airport. I know it’s confusing, but what we call visa-on-arrival, they call an arrival stamp. Some countries don’t qualify for this and are required to fill out more information. You should go straight to the booths with immigration officers.</p>

<h2 id="bangkok-skytrain">Bangkok Skytrain</h2>

<p>Get a multi-trip pass. Not so much because it’ll save you money, although it will, but because it’ll save you time. You’ll likely be taking the train to the convention center or elsewhere during rush-hour and the platform for getting tickets during that time is a madhouse. Go to the information booth at any station during an off hour to get a card.</p>

<h2 id="dress-code-for-temples">Dress Code for Temples</h2>

<p>A lot of what is written about how to dress at temples is subjective. Below are some general guidelines, but ultimately it’ll be up to the staff of the temple in question. Don’t dress like a college student on spring break and you should be fine.</p>

<p>The main thing to remember is nothing sleeveless and nothing with holes in it. Rules are less strict for men and even less strict for children. As long as men and children aren’t complete ratty looking (sleeveless shirts and holes in their pants), they should be fine. For women, ware a tee shirt and carry a sarong like below—one with a elastic waist band to slip over your shorts will work best. If you don’t have one and don’t want to buy one, most of the more touristy temples will have rentals.</p>

<h2 id="weather">Weather</h2>

<p>Even if you are from New Orleans or Mobile or Tampa, you will not be ready for the heat. My mother who grew up in Florida and has lived her whole adult life in Alabama, said it was hotter than anything she’s experienced in the States.</p>

<p>Carry an umbrella. You’ll be coming at the beginning of the rainy season, but the umbrella is mostly for the sun. You don’t want to be in a tropical monsoon with an umbrella anyway. Umbrellas are better than hats because you can angle them and they don’t keep heat in the same as a hat.</p>

<p>Drink lots of water. You’ll never be far from a 7-11 or some kind of convenience store, but it’s best to keep a bottle with you. Drink more than you would at home, you’re going to sweat more than you would at home. If you start to feel too hot, duck into a mall or convenience store for a few minutes, they’ll have A/C.</p>
