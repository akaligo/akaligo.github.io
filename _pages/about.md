You could plan your trip yourself. You could use Lonely Planet guidebooks and make all your own reservations and you'd probably spend less money. But you didn't fly to the other side of the planet to wait in the hot sun for a taxi. And there's no cultural value to eating at a bad restaurant.

There's also little cultural value in staying at 5-star hotels, eating only at hotel restaurants and never meeting any local people---viewing Thailand from a bus window as you're shuffled from sight to sight.

Thailand ETCetera is somewhere in the middle.

We like hotels that are reasonably priced, comfortable, and staffed with friendly people. We like having transportation arranged so we don't have to waste hours of our trip getting from place to place. And we want to try the local cuisine ... in the places where locals eat.

And that's what you get on a Thailand ETCetera tour.

We'll work together to make your trip an unforgettable experience. We'll make sure you meet local people and see local life. We'll take you to our favorite places and let you taste our favorite food. We'll plan your trip from beginning to end so you're never waiting for (or ripped off by) a taxi driver. There will be plenty of time for you to wander and explore by yourself. Or, if you prefer, you can have a guide with you 24/7. Your itinerary will be custom made to suite your tastes.
