        <p>Thailand ETCetera being the custom travel company we are, it’s hard to make strong rules about our service. Everyone’s holiday is different, so their bookings, payments and other details will be different. Below is standard stuff. Please read carefully as these terms set our respective rights and obligations. Once you pay your invoice, you accept these terms and conditions.</p>

        <h2 id="payments--deposits">Payments &amp; Deposits</h2>

        <p>An initial deposit is required before we can schedule you with a trip designer. This initial deposit is non-refundable but is applicable toward the final cost of your trip.</p>

        <p>After your deposit has been paid we will schedule a time for you to discuss the details of your trip with a trip designer. After which, a proposal will be emailed to you with the full price of the trip. Once you click on “accept proposal,” an invoice for the full payment will be emailed to you. There is no contract for services between you and Thailand ETCetera until this invoice has been paid. No matter what payment terms you’ve arranged with Thailand ETCetera, 100% payment is due 30 days before you begin your tour. Deposits and payments can be made by wire transfer or credit card (your invoice will have details).</p>

        <h2 id="single-travelers">Single Travelers</h2>

        <p>Our per person, per day pricing is typically higher for single travelers due to hotel room occupancy.</p>

        <h2 id="cancellations--refunds">Cancellations &amp; Refunds</h2>

        <p>All cancellation requests must be sent to Thailand ETCetera by email to info@thailandetcetera.com with “Cancellation” in the subject line.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The $300 USD deposit will not be refunded.</li>
          <li>Any third party bookings, already paid before the cancellation request, will not be refunded.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Any monies paid minus the above will be refunded as follows:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>90 days or more prior to arrival*: 100%</li>
          <li>60 days prior to arrival: 50%</li>
          <li>30 days prior to arrival: 25%</li>
          <li>29 days or less prior to arrival: no refund</li>
        </ul>

        <p>*Arrival as used in this agreement is defined as the date of your arrival into Thailand (Indochina Time Zone) on your confirmed itinerary.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>No refund once the trip has commenced.</li>
          <li>There will be no refund for unused services, early departures, late arrivals or missed days of your final itinerary.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="cancellations-by-thailand-etcetera">Cancellations by Thailand ETCetera</h2>

        <p>Cancellation by Thailand ETCetera may be necessary in exceptional circumstances. These would include: hostilities, political unrest, or other circumstances beyond our control. In the unlikely event of such circumstances, we reserve the right to cancel our tour services. If a trip must be canceled for any reason, there will be a prompt and full refund of any monies paid to Thailand ETCetera less any non-refundable deposits made to third party suppliers. We will not be responsible or liable for deposits, payments, or penalties for services not booked through Thailand ETCetera.</p>

        <h2 id="changes-by-thailand-etcetera">Changes by Thailand ETCetera</h2>

        <p>If deemed necessary for your safety or comfort, we may alter or change an itinerary. Thailand ETCetera reserves the right to re-price, cancel, or otherwise change your itinerary for any reason prior to departure. We will make every effort to operate trips as planned but changes may occur after the final itinerary has been approved and your invoice has been paid. If this happens we will do our best to make these changes within the approved budget, but if we are unable to do so, additional costs may be passed on to you.</p>

        <h2 id="changes-by-you">Changes by You</h2>

        <p>Should you or members of your party wish to make changes after your itinerary has been finalized, please email us. That said, we will not refund the cost of cancelled services or activities and we will not reimburse you for any personal expenses such as airline tickets, hotels, or other travel expenses booked separately from Thailand ETCetera.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>There is a $100 per change service charge after the itinerary is accepted; all change requests must be made to us in writing by email.</li>
          <li>Changes to an itinerary may result in additional charges depending on the type and scope of the change.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="postponements">Postponements</h2>

        <p>If you’d like to postpone your trip, we are happy to put your itinerary on hold instead of canceling the trip, provided your new dates align with our availability. Requests must be sent to Thailand ETCetera by email to info@thailandetcetera.com with “Postponement” in the subject line.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>There is a $200 rebooking fee for postponed trips.</li>
          <li>Any third party bookings, already paid before the postponement request, that are unable to be refunded will result in additional charges.</li>
          <li>Changes to an itinerary may result in additional charges depending on the type and scope of the change.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="insurance">Insurance</h2>

        <p>Thailand ETCetera purchases the entry-level <a href="http://thailandtravelshield.tourismthailand.org/">Thailand Travel Shield</a> insurance package for all guests (under the age of 70). We do not require our guests to purchase additional insurance, but we encourage you to consider it. In either event, Thailand ETCetera takes no responsibility for any injuries or loss incurred while you are taking part in any activities arranged by us. While we will advise you along the way, we accept no responsibility for the theft, loss, or damage to personal belongings during your tour.</p>

        <h2 id="your-obligations-and-responsibilities">Your obligations and responsibilities</h2>

        <p>It is your responsibility to have all necessary visas, passports, permits, and certificates required for your selected itinerary as well as any necessary vaccinations and to comply with all applicable laws. But don’t worry, your trip designer will discuss this with you.</p>

        <p>Thailand requires foreign guests to have six months of passport validity when visiting. You can check other requirements for your country at the <a href="https://www.immigration.go.th/">Thailand immigration website</a>.</p>

        <p>You should inform us of any medical condition (such as food allergies), personal preferences (such as dietary restrictions), or other needs that may require attention or medication. The best time to do this is when you fill out the contact form on our website, the second best time is when you are talking with your trip designer. This ensures that we have ample time to make the appropriate bookings to fit your needs.</p>

        <p>You must bring your own medications or prescribed drugs and make sure that these are allowed into Thailand. We will make reasonable efforts to convey any dietary restrictions to your tour guides, hotel staff, or other service providers. However, we cannot guarantee that any dietary needs or restrictions can be accommodated. It is your responsibility to ask any necessary questions and make informed decisions about your dietary needs and restrictions while traveling.</p>

        <p>During your tour, your guide may take photographs or video of you and/or your group, and these may be used in our marketing or advertising and publicity material without obtaining any further consent from you or members of your group.</p>

        <h2 id="weather-conditions">Weather Conditions</h2>

        <p>Thailand ETCetera can not be held responsible for weather conditions. Should attractions or events be canceled due to weather, we will try to find alternative options, but refunds for those events may not be available.</p>

        <p>Please realize this is just legal stuff we have to cover. The weather in Thailand is pretty standard. The rainy season is rainy, the hot season is hot. People are used to this and it’s not often that something would suddenly close due to weather. You’ll get information from your trip advisor on what to wear and what to bring to make your holiday more pleasant.</p>

        <h2 id="smoking-policy">Smoking Policy</h2>

        <p>We do not permit smoking in any vehicle during our tours. At locations such as temples, hotels, restaurants, etc, the location’s smoking policy will apply.</p>

        <h2 id="alcoholic-beverage-policy">Alcoholic Beverage Policy</h2>

        <p>We ask that you not drink alcoholic beverages while out with Thailand ETCetera guides. We will not purchase alcoholic beverages for our guests and will not be responsible for your behavior or any damages as a result of intoxication. If you become intoxicated while out with a Thailand ETCetera guide, you will put you in a taxi back to your hotel, at your expense, and all services or activities you miss due to your intoxication will be forfeited.</p>

        <h2 id="indemnification">Indemnification</h2>

        <p>In no event will Thailand ETCetera be liable to you or any third party for damages or losses arising from or in connection with the services provided by our company or the services contracted by our company with a third-party service provider.</p>

        <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Thailand ETCetera, our subsidiaries, affiliates, and all of our respective officers, agents, partners, and employees, from any loss, damage, liability, claim, or demand. In the event of legal action, you agree to pay Thailand ETCetera’s legal fees, including, but not limited to our attorneys’ fees.</p>

        <p>This is a legal and binding agreement between you and Thailand ETCetera. This agreement is a legal document under jurisdiction of the Courts of the State of Alabama. By paying your invoice, you represent that you have the authority to enter into this agreement.</p>
